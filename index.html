    Judas Priest are an English heavy metal band formed in Birmingham in 1969. They have sold over 50 million copies of their albums,<br/>
    and are frequently ranked as one of the greatest metal bands of all time. Despite an innovative and pioneering body of work in the<br/>
    latter half of the 1970s, the band had struggled with indifferent record production and a lack of major commercial success until 1980,<br/>
    when they rose to commercial success with the album British Steel.<br/>
    <br/>
    The band's membership has seen much turnover, including a revolving cast of drummers in the 1970s and the departure of singer<br/>
    Rob Halford in 1992. The American singer Tim "Ripper" Owens replaced Halford in 1996 and recorded two albums with Judas Priest, before<br/>
    Halford returned to the band in 2003. The current line-up consists of Halford, guitarists Glenn Tipton and Richie Faulkner, bassist<br/>
    Ian Hill and drummer Scott Travis. The band's best-selling album is 1982's Screaming for Vengeance, with their most commercially successful<br/>
    line-up featuring Hill, Halford, Tipton, guitarist K. K. Downing, and drummer Dave Holland. Tipton and Hill are the only two members<br/>
    of the band to appear on every album.<br/>
    <br/>
    Halford's operatic vocal style and the twin guitar sound of Downing and Tipton have been a major influence on heavy metal bands.<br/>
    Judas Priest's image of leather, spikes, and other taboo articles of clothing were widely influential during the glam metal era of<br/>
    the 1980s. The Guardian referred to British Steel as the record that defines heavy metal. Despite a decline in exposure during the<br/>
    mid 1990s, the band has once again seen a resurgence, including worldwide tours, being inaugural inductees into the VH1 Rock Honors<br/>
    in 2006, receiving a Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance in 2010, and having their songs featured in video games such as Guitar Hero<br/>
    and the Rock Band series. Judas Priest was nominated for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame 2020 class, but did not get in.
